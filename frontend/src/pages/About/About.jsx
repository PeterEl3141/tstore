        Our sole mission in creating Con Fuco is to rectify the current, 
        mind-boggling lack of garments inspired by classical music on the marcket.
        Come on - we're talking about some of the most exciting, vibrant, and original music ever created...
        and what kind of imagery is associated with it? The naffest entourage of half-baked designs, dull colours,
        and sloppy associations that one could imagine. 

        This music was, and is, revolutionary (or it would not still be relevant).
        We hope to infuse this revolutionary spirit back into it's imagery.
        A quixotic - perhaps even ridiculous endevour.
        But one that someone must rise to!
